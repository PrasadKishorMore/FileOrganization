File Organizer – Java Console Application

Problem:
My system folder becomes messy with different file types. 
This program organizes files into folders based on their extensions.

How to Run:
1. Compile: javac FileOrganizer.java
2. Run: java FileOrganizer
3. Enter the folder path when asked.

Design Decisions:
I used Java File API to scan files, check extensions, create folders, 
and move files using simple logic and error handling.
